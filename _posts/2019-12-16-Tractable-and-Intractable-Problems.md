Many papers discuss tractable and intractable problems in their papers, if an algorithm is intractable, solving some problems using this algorithm can be time-consuming. So, what are tractable and intractable problrms?

* **Tractable Problem:** a problem that is solvable by a polynomial-time algorithm. The upper bound is polynomial. 
* **Intractable Problem:** a problem that cannot be solved by a polynomial-time algorithm. The lower bound is exponential.
